HandAndFoot
===========

A Java-based client-server card game called Hand and Foot


Entry point for a user is Main.java:main()

Entry point for a standalone server is Server.java:host()

A server can be run as part of the client process by using the File > Host Server option in the menu.

Currently, this project has been tested with two players, four players is the normal minimum number of players for Hand and Foot. This value can be changed in Server.java

The login process seems pointless now, I will probably change this to a nickname system in the future. The current user/pass's are "1"/"" and "2"/""
